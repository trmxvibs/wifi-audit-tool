# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This job is named "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Define a strategy for running the job with multiple Python versions
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up a specific version of Python
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # It's good practice to upgrade pip first and install dependencies from a requirements file.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install flake8 pytest pytest-mock
          if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi

      # Step 4: Lint with flake8
      # This step checks your code for style issues and simple errors.
      - name: Lint with flake8
        run: |
          # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
          flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
          # exit-zero treats all errors as warnings. The GitHub editor is 127 chars wide
          flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics

      # Step 5: Run tests with pytest
      # This step runs the tests found in your repository.
      # We set PYTHONPATH=. so pytest can find your 'modules' directory.
      - name: Test with pytest
        run: |
